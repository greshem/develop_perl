s_client	 This implements a generic SSL/TLS client which can establish a transparent connection to a remote server
 speaking SSL/TLS. It's intended for testing purposes only and provides only rudimentary interface functionality
 but internally uses mostly all functionality of the OpenSSL ssl library.

s_server	 This implements a generic SSL/TLS server which accepts connections from remote clients speaking SSL/TLS. It's
 intended for testing purposes only and provides only rudimentary interface functionality but internally uses
 mostly all functionality of the OpenSSL ssl library.  It provides both an own command line oriented protocol
 for testing SSL functions and a simple HTTP response facility to emulate an SSL/TLS-aware webserver.
